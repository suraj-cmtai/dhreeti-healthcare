the project taht i am working on Dhreeti-Healthcare , this is a nextjs 15 project.
you only have to make changes in the Dhreeti-Healthcare folder only.
the product uses shadcn latest with tailwind css 4.
the project has a dashboard and frontend and uses redux for state management.

app folder contains main code, api routes, dashboard etc.
components contains shadcn components and common components used in app.
lib contains redux folder for provider, store and slice.

middleware.ts contains the middleware for dashboard and profile.

always check the package.json and components/ui folder before installing any module or components.

and if need to install use the powershell commands not bash or linux.


and install in root folder
